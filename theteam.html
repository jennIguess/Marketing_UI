<h2> Our Story:

When we began Expat Journal, we had one goal in mind: to preserve your travel memories. Whether it be an insightful interaction with a local resident, a pleasant walk through a city's marketplace, tasting a particularly adventurous delicacy, an ancient historical landmark, or simply a gorgeous view from your homestead or favorite local hiking spot, Expat Journal aims to keep your memories fresh by allowing you to save your journey in a grid of reminiscence. So whether you're planning a relocation, new to your host country, or looking for an innovative way to store the many new experiences you encounter, Expat Journal is the place for you.
