  <p>What is Expat Journal? It's an amazing way to show off your worldly travels on a more personal basis than other social media sites allow. An Expatriate, or Expat, is an individual who travels outside their home country to live and work in a brand new place, in efforts to engage in a different culture and gain the knowledge that comes with it. As an Expat, you may find yourself faced with ever so many new and exciting experiences, in a plethora of countries to which you travel. How will you store these memories lest they get lost in the cloud? You need a simple, yet detail oriented platform to showcase the countries that have hosted you, and recall not only the visual memories but also your personal stories as you make your way along your cultural journey. Are you ready to chronical your expat? Join thousands of Expatriates today, and discover the beauty of Expat Journal!</p>
